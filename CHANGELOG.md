# Changelog

All notable changes to robobuilder.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-23

New skill: `blueprint-sync` — keeps design documents honest as code evolves.

### Added
- `skills/utils/blueprint-sync/` — new cross-cutting skill with 4 modes:
  - `drift-check`: detect gaps between docs and code, output a structured drift report
  - `update-docs`: surgically update docs to match current reality, commit changes
  - `retrospective`: post-ship review + doc sync + optional ADR creation
  - `living-doc`: lightweight single-pass update after small PRs
  - Auto-detects mode from context (post-ship → retrospective, etc.)
- `ship` skill: added `/robobuilder:blueprint-sync` to See Also; added post-ship suggestion rule to Important Rules

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-12

Polish & ship release. Same skill/agent/hook surface as v1.0; security and ergonomics hardening.

### Added
- robobuilder pedagogy preamble on all 33 ingested SKILL.md (What / When / See Also / Bootcamp / Origin) — propagated by `scripts/dev/update_skill_frontmatter.py`, idempotent on re-run
- `origin:`, `bootcamp_module:`, `bootcamp_url:` frontmatter fields on every ingested skill (Living Knowledge Loop scaffolding)
- 29 new unit tests under `scripts/tests/` covering `auto_format.py`, `memory_consolidate.py`, `notification.py` (90 tests total, all passing)
- `scripts/tests/conftest.py` with shared fixtures (`run_script`, `tmp_memory_dir`); runtime-built attack strings so tests don't trip block_secrets when edited in-session
- `scripts/pytest.ini` + `scripts/tests/README.md`
- Test-fixture exemption for content scanning in `block_secrets.py` — paths under `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `fixtures/`, `*_test.py`, `conftest.py`, `*.spec.{ts,js,tsx,jsx}`, `*.test.{ts,js,tsx,jsx}` skip CONTENT scanning (file-name scanning still applies)
- Legacy binary installer supply-chain guard in `install_binaries.sh` — refused to auto-confirm installs from moving branch tips before the installer was replaced by a no-op compatibility shim
- `## Security-sensitive code` section in `CLAUDE.md.baseline`
- Explicit precedence note in `settings.json.example` (deny → ask → allow, verified against docs)

### Changed
- `block_secrets.py` `_audit_log()` now uses `Path.home()` (OS-API resolution) instead of `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` env reads — not hijackable by env manipulation

### Documented
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` — `.md.bak` and other compound-extension edge cases as known limitations

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-11

Initial release. Built and reviewed in one session.

### Plugin surface
- 40 SKILL.md across 11 phase directories (meta, phase0, phase05, phase1, phase2, phase3, phase35, phase4, phase5, utils, playbooks)
  - 33 ingested from Matt Pocock (13, MIT), GStack (10, MIT), Jin custom (10)
  - 3 robobuilder-original meta-skills: `start`, `tune-claude-md`, `upgrade`, `install-companions`
  - 3 playbooks: `playbook-new-feature`, `playbook-bug-fix`, `playbook-review-deep`
- 9 phase-specific subagents (5 new for robobuilder: `codebase-explorer`, `design-critic`, `requirements-validator`, `tdd-pair`, `release-notes-writer`)
- 6 lifecycle hooks (SessionStart / PreToolUse / PostToolUse / Notification / PreCompact / SessionEnd)
- 4 Python hook scripts + 3 setup shell scripts
- 6 documentation files
- `CLAUDE.md.baseline` for `/robobuilder:tune-claude-md` personalization wizard
- `company.yaml` — Robo Co-op intelligence (Teams / Asana / 1Password / Vercel / Supabase / Stripe / Azure SQL / Notion)
- `marketplace.json` registering robobuilder under `robo-coop-tools` marketplace

### Security fixes (caught by `/cross-review` 5 rounds, before any release)
- PowerShell command injection in `notification.py` (no user content interpolation; sound-only)
- AppleScript injection in `notification.py` (`_sanitize()` strips non-printable + injection chars)
- Supply-chain pinning for `install_binaries.sh` (3-path coverage: fresh / upgrade / re-run + AUTO_YES env var for CI)
- `memory_consolidate.py` stat-after-open bug (header duplicated on every invocation; now checked before `open("a")`)
- `block_secrets.py` credentials regex prefix bug (`db_credentials.json` was bypassing)
- `block_secrets.py` MultiEdit content not scanned (now iterates `edits[*].new_string`)
- Expanded `block_secrets.py` SECRET_CONTENT_PATTERNS to cover: Stripe (live/test), GitHub variants (p/s/o/r/u), JWT, Azure connection strings, 1Password service-account tokens
- `block_secrets.py` doc-extension lookbehind so docs like `credentials-management-guide.md` are not blocked
- Tightened `settings.json.example` deny patterns (`.env.local`, `.envrc`, `id_rsa`, `wget -O- | sh`, etc.)
- Audit log to `~/.claude/logs/block_secrets.log` for blocked attempts
