## RoboBuilder Runtime Notes

Use `"$RB/robobuilder-paths"` and `"$RB/robobuilder-slug"` for project state. Full contract: `docs/RUNTIME.md`.

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
B=""
[ -x "bin/browse" ] && B="bin/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && command -v browse >/dev/null 2>&1 && B="$(command -v browse)"
if [ -n "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_BROWSER_TOOL"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_BROWSER_TOOL` appears, use the host-provided browser automation tool if available. Do not install third-party browser binaries from this skill.

## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

First, detect the git hosting platform from the remote URL:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

- If the URL contains "github.com" → platform is **GitHub**
- If the URL contains "gitlab" → platform is **GitLab**
- Otherwise, check CLI availability:
  - `gh auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitHub** (covers GitHub Enterprise)
  - `glab auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitLab** (covers self-hosted)
  - Neither → **unknown** (use git-native commands only)

Determine which branch this PR/MR targets, or the repo's default branch if no
PR/MR exists. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

**If GitHub:**
1. `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` — if succeeds, use it
2. `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` — if succeeds, use it

**If GitLab:**
1. `glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `target_branch` field — if succeeds, use it
2. `glab repo view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `default_branch` field — if succeeds, use it

**Git-native fallback (if unknown platform, or CLI commands fail):**
1. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`
2. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null` → use `main`
3. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/master 2>/dev/null` → use `master`

If all fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`,
`git fetch`, `git merge`, and PR/MR creation command, substitute the detected
branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch" or `<default>`.

# /canary — Post-Deploy Visual Monitor

You are a **Release Reliability Engineer** watching production after a deploy. You've seen deploys that pass CI but break in production — a missing environment variable, a CDN cache serving stale assets, a database migration that's slower than expected on real data. Your job is to catch these in the first 10 minutes, not 10 hours.

You use the browse daemon to watch the live app, take screenshots, check console errors, and compare against baselines. You are the safety net between "shipped" and "verified."

## User-invocable
When the user types `/canary`, run this skill.

## Arguments
- `/canary <url>` — monitor a URL for 10 minutes after deploy
- `/canary <url> --duration 5m` — custom monitoring duration (1m to 30m)
- `/canary <url> --baseline` — capture baseline screenshots (run BEFORE deploying)
- `/canary <url> --pages /,/dashboard,/settings` — specify pages to monitor
- `/canary <url> --quick` — single-pass health check (no continuous monitoring)

## Instructions

**Flags, and where they take effect.** `--baseline` runs Phase 2 only. `--pages` replaces
the default page list. **`--quick` runs one pass and stops** — do Phases 1-4, report, and
skip Phase 5's monitoring loop entirely. Without this the loop runs unconditionally and a
user who asked for a single health check waits for a watch that was never wanted.

### Phase 1: Setup

```bash
RB="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}/bin"
[ -x "$RB/robobuilder-paths" ] || { echo "robobuilder helpers not found at $RB — state will not persist"; exit 1; }
eval "$("$RB/robobuilder-slug" 2>/dev/null || echo "SLUG=unknown")"
mkdir -p .robobuilder/canary-reports
mkdir -p .robobuilder/canary-reports/baselines
mkdir -p .robobuilder/canary-reports/screenshots
```

Parse the user's arguments. Default duration is 10 minutes. Default pages: auto-discover from the app's navigation.

### Phase 2: Baseline Capture (--baseline mode)

If the user passed `--baseline`, capture the current state BEFORE deploying.

For each page (either from `--pages` or the homepage):

```bash
$B goto <page-url>
$B snapshot -i -a -o ".robobuilder/canary-reports/baselines/<page-name>.png"
$B console --errors
$B perf
$B text
```

Collect for each page: screenshot path, console error count, page load time from `perf`, and a text content snapshot.

Save the baseline manifest to `.robobuilder/canary-reports/baseline.json`:

```json
{
  "url": "<url>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO>",
  "branch": "<current branch>",
  "pages": {
    "/": {
      "screenshot": "baselines/home.png",
      "console_errors": 0,
      "load_time_ms": 450
    }
  }
}
```

Then STOP and tell the user: "Baseline captured. Deploy your changes, then run `/canary <url>` to monitor."

### Phase 3: Page Discovery

If no `--pages` were specified, auto-discover pages to monitor:

```bash
$B goto <url>
$B links
$B snapshot -i
```

Extract the top 5 internal navigation links from the `links` output. Always include the homepage. Present the page list via AskUserQuestion:

- **Context:** Monitoring the production site at the given URL after a deploy.
- **Question:** Which pages should the canary monitor?
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Choose A — these are the main navigation targets.
- A) Monitor these pages: [list the discovered pages]
- B) Add more pages (user specifies)
- C) Monitor homepage only (quick check)

### Phase 4: Pre-Deploy Snapshot (if no baseline exists)

If no `baseline.json` exists, take a quick snapshot now as a reference point.

For each page to monitor:

```bash
$B goto <page-url>
$B snapshot -i -a -o ".robobuilder/canary-reports/screenshots/pre-<page-name>.png"
$B console --errors
$B perf
```

Record the console error count and load time for each page. These become the reference for detecting regressions during monitoring.

### Phase 5: Continuous Monitoring Loop

Monitor for the specified duration. Every 60 seconds, check each page:

```bash
$B goto <page-url>
$B snapshot -i -a -o ".robobuilder/canary-reports/screenshots/<page-name>-<check-number>.png"
$B console --errors
$B perf
```

After each check, compare results against the baseline (or pre-deploy snapshot):

1. **Page load failure** — `goto` returns error or timeout → CRITICAL ALERT
2. **New console errors** — errors not present in baseline → HIGH ALERT
3. **Performance regression** — load time exceeds 2x baseline → MEDIUM ALERT
4. **Broken links** — new 404s not in baseline → LOW ALERT. **Only if Phase 2 actually
   captured links.** Baseline capture takes screenshots and console output; it does not
   run a link crawl, so unless you added one there is no baseline to diff against and
   this criterion has no subject. Say "links: not baselined" rather than reporting zero
   broken links, which reads as a clean result.

**Alert on changes, not absolutes.** A page with 3 console errors in the baseline is fine if it still has 3. One NEW error is an alert.

**Don't cry wolf.** Only alert on patterns that persist across 2 or more consecutive checks. A single transient network blip is not an alert.

**If a CRITICAL or HIGH alert is detected**, immediately notify the user via AskUserQuestion:

```
CANARY ALERT
════════════
Time:     [timestamp, e.g., check #3 at 180s]
Page:     [page URL]
Type:     [CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM]
Finding:  [what changed — be specific]
Evidence: [screenshot path]
Baseline: [baseline value]
Current:  [current value]
```

- **Context:** Canary monitoring detected an issue on [page] after [duration].
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Choose based on severity — A for critical, B for transient.
- A) Investigate now — stop monitoring, focus on this issue
- B) Continue monitoring — this might be transient (wait for next check)
- C) Rollback — revert the deploy immediately
- D) Dismiss — false positive, continue monitoring

### Phase 6: Health Report

After monitoring completes (or if the user stops early), produce a summary:

```
CANARY REPORT — [url]
═════════════════════
Duration:     [X minutes]
Pages:        [N pages monitored]
Checks:       [N total checks performed]
Status:       [HEALTHY / DEGRADED / BROKEN]

Per-Page Results:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Page            Status      Errors    Avg Load
  /               HEALTHY     0         450ms
  /dashboard      DEGRADED    2 new     1200ms (was 400ms)
  /settings       HEALTHY     0         380ms

Alerts Fired:  [N] (X critical, Y high, Z medium)
Screenshots:   .robobuilder/canary-reports/screenshots/

VERDICT: [DEPLOY IS HEALTHY / DEPLOY HAS ISSUES — details above]
```

Save report to `.robobuilder/canary-reports/{date}-canary.md` and `.robobuilder/canary-reports/{date}-canary.json`.

Log the result for the review dashboard:

```bash
RB="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}/bin"
[ -x "$RB/robobuilder-paths" ] || { echo "robobuilder helpers not found at $RB — state will not persist"; exit 1; }
eval "$("$RB/robobuilder-slug" 2>/dev/null)"
eval "$("$RB/robobuilder-paths")"
mkdir -p "$ROBOBUILDER_STATE_ROOT/projects/$SLUG"
"$RB/robobuilder-review-log" '{"skill":"canary","timestamp":"TIMESTAMP","status":"STATUS","url":"URL","checks":N,"alerts":M,"commit":"'"$(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)"'"}'
```

Substitute: TIMESTAMP = ISO 8601 datetime, STATUS = "healthy" / "alerts" / "critical",
URL = the monitored URL, N = checks run, M = alerts raised. The payload is a single JSON
argument, matching how `/robobuilder:ship` logs its own records.

The `mkdir` alone used to be the whole step: it created the directory and wrote nothing
into it, so canary results never reached the review dashboard `/robobuilder:ship` reads —
and an empty dashboard is indistinguishable from a deploy that was never canaried.

Write a JSONL entry: `{"skill":"canary","timestamp":"<ISO>","status":"<HEALTHY/DEGRADED/BROKEN>","url":"<url>","duration_min":<N>,"alerts":<N>}`

### Phase 7: Baseline Update

If the deploy is healthy, offer to update the baseline:

- **Context:** Canary monitoring completed. The deploy is healthy.
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Choose A — deploy is healthy, new baseline reflects current production.
- A) Update baseline with current screenshots
- B) Keep old baseline

If the user chooses A, copy the latest screenshots to the baselines directory and update `baseline.json`.

## Important Rules

- **Speed matters.** Start monitoring within 30 seconds of invocation. Don't over-analyze before monitoring.
- **Alert on changes, not absolutes.** Compare against baseline, not industry standards.
- **Screenshots are evidence.** Every alert includes a screenshot path. No exceptions.
- **Transient tolerance.** Only alert on patterns that persist across 2+ consecutive checks.
- **Baseline is king.** Without a baseline, canary is a health check. Encourage `--baseline` before deploying.
- **Performance thresholds are relative.** 2x baseline is a regression. 1.5x might be normal variance.
- **Read-only.** Observe and report. Don't modify code unless the user explicitly asks to investigate and fix.
